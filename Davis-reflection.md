Prior to this GPS session, I only understand how to interact with people using github in theory.

This GPS clarified how users interact in github.

*I'm not confused so far about git.*

My first experience of pairing in a GPS was great! I enjoyed the energy and acceping nature of my partner Kaybe. The guide, Celeen was also very nice and helpful.
